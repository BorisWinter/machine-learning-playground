# Machine Learning | Playground

This repository is used as a place to play around with machine learning algorithms. We differentiate between three types of algorithms:

1. [Supervised learning](https://github.com/BorisWinter/machine-learning-playground/tree/main/supervised_learning)
2. [Unsupervised learning](/unsupervised_learning)
3. [Semi-supervised learning](https://github.com/BorisWinter/machine-learning-playground/tree/main/semi_supervised_learning)
