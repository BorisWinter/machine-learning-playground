# Supervised Learning

Overview of supervised learning algorithms. 

## Contents
- Each algorithm has their own directory in which the algorithm is explained and an example implementation can be found.
- The test_algorithms.ipynb file contains a Jupyter notebook in which each of the algorithms is tested on sample data from scikit-learn.
- The dependencies for the testing file can be found in requirements.txt and can be installed using pip:
- > python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


## Use Cases
