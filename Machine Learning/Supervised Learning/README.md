# Supervised Learning

Overview of supervised learning algorithms. 

## Contents
- The data directory contains sample data
- Each algorithm has their own directory in which the algorithm is explained and an example implementation can be found.
- The test_algorithms.ipynb file contains a Jupyter notebook in which each of the algorithms is tested on the sample data.

## Use Cases
