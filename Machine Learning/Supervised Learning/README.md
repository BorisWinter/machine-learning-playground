# Supervised Learning

Overview of supervised learning algorithms. 

## Contents
- Each algorithm has their own directory in which the algorithm is explained and an example implementation can be found.
- The test_algorithms.ipynb file contains a Jupyter notebook in which each of the algorithms is tested on sample data from scikit-learn.

## Use Cases
Supervised machine learning is used when...
- Example 1
- Example 2

## Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-nearest neighbor (kNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random forests
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
